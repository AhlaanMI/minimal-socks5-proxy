# Reflection

(Write 2â€“3 paragraphs covering: what you had to learn, how you debugged, what to improve.)

Suggested prompts:

- Which parts of SOCKS5 spec did you read / reference?
- Any tricky binary parsing issues and how you verified bytes?
- How did you test failure paths (bad auth, unsupported command)?
- If more time: which features or robustness improvements first?
